## Data Structures

### Heap 
- Priority Queue
- A complete binary tree
- Value of each node must be no greater than (or no less than) the value of its child nodes
- Time Complexity
    - insertion: O(logN)
    - deletion: O(logN)
    - finding minimun/maximum: O(1)
- can be used to implement priority queue


### Graph
- Disjoint Set
- find()
- union()
- union by rank
